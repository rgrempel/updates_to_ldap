updates_to_ldap
===============

The purpose of this gem is to allow you to mirror ActiveRecord data to LDAP.

It differs from something like ActiveLDAP in that the LDAP directory is not
the authoritative source for the information. Instead, you maintain the
information in ActiveRecord, and merely use the LDAP as a presentational
tool.
